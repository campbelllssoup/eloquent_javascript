// Exercise 9-3: Numbers Again : NOT DONE...

/*
    Write an expression that matches only Javascript-style numbers.
    It must support an optional minus or plus sign in front of the 
    number, the decimal dot, and exponent notation - 5e-3 || 1E10 -
    again with an optional sign in front of the exponent. Also note
    that it is not necessary for there to be digits in front of or
    after the dot, but the number cannot be a dot alone. That is, ".5"
    and "5." are validf JavaScript numbers, but a lone dot isn't.
