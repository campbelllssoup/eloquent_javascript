// Exercise 21-2: Comment Field Resets : DONE!!!

/*

  The wholesale redrawing of talks works pretty well because you usually canâ€™t 
  tell the difference between a DOM node and its identical replacement. But 
  there are exceptions. If you start typing something in the comment field for 
  a talk in one browser window and then, in another, add a comment to that talk, 
  the field in the first window will be redrawn, removing both its content and 
  its focus.

  In a heated discussion, where multiple people are adding comments at the same 
  time, this would be annoying. Can you come up with a way to solve it?

  // copied solution.
