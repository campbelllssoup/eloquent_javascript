<!-- Exercise 19-2: Efficient Drawing : DONE!!!

  During drawing, the majority of work that our application does happens in 
  drawPicture. Creating a new state and updating the rest of the DOM isn’t very 
  expensive, but repainting all the pixels on the canvas is quite a bit of work.

  Find a way to make the syncState method of PictureCanvas faster by redrawing 
  only the pixels that actually changed.

  Remember that drawPicture is also used by the save button, so if you change 
  it, either make sure the changes don’t break the old use or create a new 
  version with a different name.

  Also note that changing the size of a <canvas> element, by setting its width 
  or height properties, clears it, making it entirely transparent again.
