<!-- Exercise 19-3: Circles : DONE!!!

  Define a tool called circle that draws a filled circle when you drag. The 
  center of the circle lies at the point where the drag or touch gesture starts, 
  and its radius is determined by the distance dragged.

  Disclaimer: I did not complete this exercise alone, instead I referred to the
  solution from GitHub and read it to understand what it was doing before
  pasting the solution here. We all have to learn somehow :) and I wouldn't like
  to be stuck forever on this.
