<!-- Exercise 16-1: Game Over : DONE!!!

  Itâ€™s traditional for platform games to have the player start with a limited 
  number of lives and subtract one life each time they die. When the player is 
  out of lives, the game restarts from the beginning.

  Adjust runGame to implement lives. Have the player start with three. Output 
  the current number of lives (using console.log) every time a level starts.
