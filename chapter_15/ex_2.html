<!-- Exercise 15-2: Mouse Trail : DONE!!!

  In JavaScript’s early days, which was the high time of gaudy home pages with 
  lots of animated images, people came up with some truly inspiring ways to use 
  the language.

  One of these was the mouse trail — a series of elements that would follow the 
  mouse pointer as you moved it across the page.

  In this exercise, I want you to implement a mouse trail. Use absolutely 
  positioned <div> elements with a fixed size and background color (refer to 
  the code in the “Mouse Clicks” section for an example). Create a bunch of 
  such elements and, when the mouse moves, display them in the wake of the 
  mouse pointer.

  There are various possible approaches here. You can make your solution as 
  simple or as complex as you want. A simple solution to start with is to keep 
  a fixed number of trail elements and cycle through them, moving the next one 
  to the mouse’s current position every time a "mousemove" event occurs.
