        <!-- It helps me to think of the context object as a paintbrush. You can 
        set the strokeStyle to change the color of the shape you're about to 
        draw - yet you can also dip that brush in water and select a new color
        by simply setting the context object's strokeStyle to a new color. Also,
        just like a painting, once an object is drawn it's finished.. no further
        modifications to the context object will affect what has already been
        drawn. -->
