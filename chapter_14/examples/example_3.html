          /* images is a 'live' data collection, which means changes
          to the collection are reflected in real time. Due to this,
          if you want to modify a live collection, you should count
          from the back to the front. 
          
          For example, you have two images that are in the live collection.
          If you start from the beginning and turn the image element node into
          a text node, then the length of the list goes from 2 to 1 in real time.
          
          In turn, whenever you're trying to access the 2nd element in the 
          collection, undefined will be returned because there is no longer
          a second element.*/

          // an HTMLCollection is saved into the images variable below.
          // HTMLCollections are always live.
          let images = document.getElementsByTagName("img");
